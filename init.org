* Initialization File

This file serves as the first thing when we boot emacs. From here we setup some
defaults and some things we'll use throughout the rest of configuration.

** Use Package

Sets up ~use-package~ [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][(link)]] which in short
provides a common way to load and access packages.
