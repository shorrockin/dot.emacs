* Bindings

This file simply contains a collection of key bindings that is common to
all modes. It doesn't really require more explanation than that.

** Standard Emacs Binding

We split our bindings into two sections, first standard emacs.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(global-set-key [f7] 'align-regexp)
(global-set-key [f8] 'call-last-kbd-macro)
(global-set-key [f5] 'revert-buffer)

(global-set-key [A-down] 'shrink-window)
(global-set-key [A-up] 'enlarge-window)
(global-set-key [A-right] 'enlarge-window-horizontally)
(global-set-key [A-left] 'shrink-window-horizontally)
(global-set-key [A-backspace] 'balance-windows)

(global-set-key (kbd "M-/") 'hippie-expand)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-b") 'ibuffer)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-s") 'isearch-forward-regexp)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-r") 'isearch-backward-regexp)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-s") 'isearch-forward)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-M-r") 'isearch-backward)

(global-set-key (kbd "C-/") 'comment-or-uncomment-region-or-line)
#+END_SRC

** Evil Bindings

Then we add our evil-specific bindings, using the leader key (defined as ~<SPC>~)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(evil-leader/set-key
  "a" 'align-regexp
  "/" 'comment-or-uncomment-region-or-line
  "g" 'ftf-grepsource
  "f" 'projectile-find-file
  "." 'dumb-jump-go
  "*" 'dumb-jump-back)
#+END_SRC
