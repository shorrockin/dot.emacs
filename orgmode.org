* Org Mode

This file is meant to provide a place to centralize all the org-mode config.
It probably doesn't need to be in it's own file, however, in doing so it allows
me to document things as I figure it out.

** Reading Material

Here are some references for org mode that were useful while learning org-mode
better:

** Todo Setup

The following sets up our default TODO
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO" "IN-PROGRESS" "WAITING" "|" "DONE" "CANCELED")))
#+END_SRC

These can all be overridden by declaring something like the following at
the head of any org file.

~#+TODO: TODO IN-PROGRESS WAITING | DONE CANCELED~

Forces all child tasks to be marked as done before the parent can
be marked as done.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq org-enforce-todo-dependencies t)
#+END_SRC

Adds a timestamp annotation for when the task is marked as complete.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq org-log-done (quote time))
#+END_SRC

Sets up ~org-indent-mode~ to be on by default which [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Clean-view.html][cleans up]] how things are
displayed in regards to indentation.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq org-startup-indented t)
#+END_SRC

Sets the initial visiblity of an opened file. To define this specifically on
a per file basis check out [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Initial-visibility.html][this]] link.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq org-startup-folded "content")
#+END_SRC

Customizes the ellipsis which indicates when things can be unfolded.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq org-ellipsis "â¤µ")
#+END_SRC

** Agenda Setup

First we define a home for all our org files. We're going to default to a directory
inside our ~emacs.d~ dir that is git ignored and can be sym-linked to dropbox or
whatever you prefer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/.emacs.d/org"))
#+END_SRC

When we ~M-x 'org-agenda~ this provides a custom view of everything all together.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("c" "Simple agenda view"
         ((agenda "")
          (alltodo "")))))
#+END_SRC

** Key Bindings

Here We setup some org-mode bindings to match my preferences, first to undo-the
mappings for shift-<arrow>, as I use these to navigate between my buffers.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "S-<left>") nil)
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "S-<right>") nil)
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "S-<up>") nil)
(define-key org-mode-map (kbd "S-<down>") nil)
#+END_SRC

Now we add some evil-mode [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader][leader]] bindings to perform some other common tasks
specifically for ~org-mode~.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(evil-leader/set-key-for-mode 'org-mode
  "a" 'org-agenda
  "t" 'org-shiftright
  "T" 'org-shiftleft
  "1" 'org-priority-up
  "." 'org-shiftmetaright
  "," 'org-shiftmetaleft
  "<RET>" 'org-insert-todo-heading
  "d" 'org-deadline)
#+END_SRC
